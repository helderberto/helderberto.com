Following the tradition of [Elton Minetto](https://eltonminetto.dev/), who shares his most used apps and services (you can read his 2024 version [here](https://eltonminetto.dev/en/post/2024-11-04-apps-services-2024/)), I'd like to share my own list of essential tools that boost my productivity and help me stay in the flow.

Here's my curated list by category:

## Software Development

- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty): A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator for lightning-fast performance.
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): A terminal multiplexer that allows for multiple terminal sessions within a single window.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Vim Keybindings](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim): My primary code editor for daily work, especially when not using Neovim.
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) my [custom configs](https://github.com/helderberto/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim/.config/nvim): A text editor I've been using for years. However, I switch to VSCode for pair-programming to reduce cognitive load for colleagues more familiar with it.

If you're interested, you can check out [my personal dotfiles on GitHub](https://github.com/helderberto/dotfiles).

## Productivity

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/): Replacement for the native macOS Spotlight, similar to the classic Alfred.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/): Password and secret management vault.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/): Task management tool I use to track both personal and professional tasks.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): After experimenting with Arc Browser, I've returned to Chrome as my primary web browser.
- [Bear](https://bear.app/): A sleek note-taking app where I keep my thoughts and ideas in my own words.
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com/): My companion for listening to music and podcasts.
- [Shotrr](https://shottr.cc/): Screenshot with annotation for macOS.
- [Presentify](https://presentifyapp.com/): It helps me to annotate my screen while doing presentations.

## Wrapping Up

These are the tools I've been using in my daily life. However, I'm always seeking to try new tools that can help me out.

If you have suggestions for tools, feel free to reach me out.
