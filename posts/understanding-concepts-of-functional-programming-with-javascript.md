Let's understand the fundamental concepts of functional programming using JavaScript language.

The abbreviation FP will be used within this article to reference `functional programming`.

## Object Example

In this article we'll use the following object in our practical examples like the following:

```ts
const animals = [
  {
    name: "Max",
    species: "dog",
    likes: ["bones", "carrots"],
  },
  {
    name: "Teodore",
    species: "cat",
    likes: ["mice", "carrots"],
  },
];
```

## What is functional programming?

FP is the basis in **Lambda Calculus** - a formal system developed in the 1930s. **Lambda Calculus** is a mathematical abstraction that you could read more on [Lambda calculus definition - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus_definition).

The FP programming paradigm is focused on writing more functions and make function compositions.

## Composition

Function composition is a way to combine multiple functions to build one result.

In mathematical we write like `f(g(x))` when receiving the results from `g(x)` will be passed to the upper scope called `f`.

See the following example:

```ts
const isDog = (animals) => animals.filter((animal) => animal.species === "dog");
const isCat = (animals) => animals.filter((animal) => animal.species === "cat");
const likeCarrots = (animals) =>
  animals.filter((animal) =>
    animal.likes.find((like) => like.includes("carrots"))
  );

console.log(likeCarrots(isDog(animals)));
// => [{ name: "Max", species: "dog", likes: ["bones", "carrots" ]}]

console.log(likeCarrots(isCat(animals)));
// => [{ name: "Teodore", species: "cat", likes: ["mice", "carrots" ]}]
```

### Automate the Composition process

Let's create an automation to previous example:

```ts
const compose =
  (...fns) =>
  (x) =>
    fns.reduceRight((v, fn) => fn(v), x);

console.log(compose(isDog, likeCarrots)(animals));
// => [{ name: "Max", species: "dog", likes: ["bones", "carrots" ]}]

console.log(compose(isCat, likeCarrots)(animals));
// => [{ name: "Teodore", species: "cat", likes: ["mice", "carrots" ]}]
```

The method called `compose` will execute all functions from right to left using `reduceRight`.

_Note: we've got the same results with a much more readable and cleaner code._

Normally, when want to execute sequentially, so we use the `pipe` method like the following example:

```ts
const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  (x) =>
    fns.reduce((v, fn) => fn(v), x);

console.log(pipe(isDog, likeCarrots)(animals));
// => [{ name: "Max", species: "dog", likes: ["bones", "carrots" ]}]

console.log(pipe(isCat, likeCarrots)(animals));
// => [{ name: "Teodore", species: "cat", likes: ["mice", "carrots" ]}]
```

_Note: we've got the same results from the composed method because we just filtered the results, however, in cases you want to print different value, with is a nice approach._

I recommend the article [A quick introduction to pipe() and compose() in JavaScript](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/pipe-and-compose-in-javascript-5b04004ac937) where you may understand the concepts of pipe and compose better.

## Immutability

In immutability, we consider elements that won't mutate itself when we add a new property or change.

See an example when I've added new animal and create a new instance from `animals`:

```ts
const tildorCat = {
  name: "Tildor",
  species: "cat",
  likes: ["mice", "carrots"],
};
const mutatedAnimals = [...animals, tildorCat];

console.log(animals.length); // => 2
console.log(mutatedAnimals.length); // => 3
```

We've used the base `animals` to create a new instance with the new animal instance.

Keep in mind when talking about immutability the initial values won't change, instead, it creates a modified instance.

## Pure Functions

Pure functions are used to avoid `side-effects` so guarantee when you pass an input it will always return the same output.

# Wrapping Up

That's all folks! I tried to show some fundamentals concepts and my personal opinion about some use cases of FP, I hope it helps you.

Feel free to comment below if you have any questions, I'll be happy to help you.

Enjoy programming!
