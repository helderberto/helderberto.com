In this article we will cover the "bind" functionality that makes up the JavaScript language.

## Introduction

The main purpose of the _bind_ method is to change the _this_ context of a function independent of where it is being called.

It's very common the transformation of _this_ occurs as new method calls are made and that a certain value is expected for our _this_ context however we are faced with a _this_ many times unexpected or _undefined_.

## The _this_ context

One of the most common errors when we aren't aware of the _bind_ method is the attempt to execute methods with initially invalid contexts. Check out the following example:

```ts
function cook() {
  console.log(this.ingredients);
}
console.log(cook()); // => undefined
```

In the case that we run above we get the `undefined` value because `this` didn't receive a `ingredients` property.

## Understanding the right context

As we saw in the previous example the function expected a _this_ context with the _ingredients_ property, but didn't receive the _undefiend_ or invalid context so we will get an invalid result against the `cook` method. Check below the right way:

```ts
function cook() {
  console.log(this.ingredients);
}

let dinner = {
  ingredients: "bacon",
};
let cookBoundToDinner = cook.bind(dinner);
console.log(cookBoundToDinner()); // => "bacon"
```

You may notice in the previous example that we created the `dinner` object where we are setting the `ingredients: bacon` property and then we call the `cook` function using the _bind_ method with the `dinner` parameter that will be it's new context _this_.

## Knowing other ways without using bind

Now that we know how to work with the _bind_ method let's do the previous, but without _bind_ method. Check below:

```ts
let cook = function () {
  console.log(this.ingredients);
};

let dinner = {
  cookDinner: cook,
  ingredients: "bacon",
};
dinner.cookDinner(); // => "bacon"

let lunch = {
  cookLunch: cook,
  ingredients: "salad",
};
console.log(lunch.cookLunch()); // => "salad"
```

In the previous two examples we are using the `cook` method both in the`lunch` object and in the `dinner` object. Since the function is in the same context it will use the available property that fits your need which in the case is `ingredients` in which you returned when executing the function.

## Assigning methods in this context

You aren't limited to only assigning values to your properties, you can also use methods like properties. Check below:

```ts
let calc = function () {
  return {
    sum: this.sum,
    mult: this.mult,
    div: this.div,
  };
};

let methods = {
  sum: function (x, y) {
    return x + y;
  },
  mult: function (x, y) {
    return x * y;
  },
  div: function (x, y) {
    return x / y;
  },
};
const calcBound = calc.bind(methods);

console.log(calcBound().sum(2, 2)); // => 4
console.log(calcBound().mult(2, 3)); // => 6
console.log(calcBound().div(6, 3)); // => 2
```

In this example we used or _Higher Order Functions_ where functions are passed as parameters for the _this_ context, these being the `sum`,`mult` and `div` methods.

## Conclusion

With the above examples we can see how the _bind_ method facilitates the execution of tasks when working with _this_ contexts in different methods.
