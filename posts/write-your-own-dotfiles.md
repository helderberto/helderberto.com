Sometime ago I need to format my Mac twice times in the same week and it's was very painful to configure all the things.

I saw an opportunity to write my own `dotfiles` that can help me a lot when I need to change from a computer to another.

## Mac Setup

I recommend the [Mathias Bynens .macos](https://github.com/helderberto/dotfiles/blob/master/mac/.macos) file this helped me a lot to create my own [.macos](https://github.com/helderberto/dotfiles/blob/master/mac/.macos) configurations.

Thanks to [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) who shared these awesome configurations.

## Start Point

My dotfiles execute as a simple call-in [install.sh](https://github.com/helderberto/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh).

I followed in this project the principle of maintaining easy and simple to execute.

When I started to automate my build process and saw the other dotfiles from people I was thinking of creating a lot of files, harder automation formats, but I percept it can be easier if I follow the principle of `KISS - Keep it simple and stupid`.

## The Project

However, if you want to see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/helderberto/dotfiles) and give some feedback I'm opened to discuss and share the knowledge I gained in this project.

_Note: You will note it's more focused on frontend development because that is my focus now._

## Wrapping Up

This is was a quick post just to share my experience when I wrote my own dotfiles and how it can help you too.

Feel free to share your own experiences and if you already have dotfiles, please share in the comments it will be nice to see what you have been automated.
