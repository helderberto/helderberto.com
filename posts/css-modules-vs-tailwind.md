# CSS Modules vs Tailwind CSS

Both CSS Modules and Tailwind CSS are popular choices for styling React applications. Let's compare them:

## CSS Modules

- Scoped CSS classes
- Traditional CSS syntax
- No utility classes
- Great for component-based architecture

## Tailwind CSS

- Utility-first approach
- Rapid prototyping
- Consistent design system
- Larger bundle size

Choose the one that best fits your project's needs and team preferences.
